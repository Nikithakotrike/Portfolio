      <h5>Planning of Backtrack</h5>
      During the planning phase of backtrack all the team together have suggested and have given different ideas about the script ,how to 
      execute the timing ,Actors,when to start the work assingning the roles,locations to shoot etc and we have also practiced shooting some
      trial shots to check with the camera angles by visiting the location where we want to shoot prior we started the orginalshoot,finally 
      once everything have been done all the team have ensured that the timing of every scene in the storyboard matched our expectations to 
      avoid any inconsistencies in the video. We also made sure the video could be completed within the specified duration.

       Working in this team was fantabulous even each member has a specific role but all the team members have done multi tasking other than 
       what needs be done and we also helped each other a lot and learned lot of this this has not only made things easier but it is also 
       made us learn a lot about collaboration and problem-solving .Each team member brought unique skills and perspectives to the table,
       We also have assigned roles based on our individual strengths, ensuring that each and every team member  had a clear responsibility.

       <h5>Execution: Behind the Scenes:</h5>
        In the video shoot every one have played a dual role and we have make sure that every out come was sucessful. My Key role in the 
        project was to ensure continuity, which involved maintaining the flow and consistency across different shots during filming and 
        verifying that it was also maintained  after editing, ensuring there were no mistakes.
                      During the shooting phase, I was checking for consistent lighting, character positioning, costumes, body language of 
        the actors, and the progression of the storyline.​
       One of my  biggest challenges was maintaining continuity during re-shoots, as many scenes were re-shot 2–3 times to get them perfect.
       To overcome this, I made detailed notes for each shot, including camera angles, positions, dialogue delivery, and the timing of every
       scene. This helped me replicate the setup accurately when retaking shots. It was particularly challenging to note all the scene 
       timings and ensure continuity simultaneously.​By focusing on continuity, I contributed to making the final video feel professional and
       polished for the app demonstration.​

       <h5>Reflection:</h5>
       I learned a lot from the project. Specifically, this role emphasized the importance of attention to detail and how even small inconsistencies 
       can significantly affect a project’s overall impact. It also enhanced my teamwork,problem-solving,Communication,adaptability skills  and  I 
       collaborated closely with my teammates during the editing phase to achieve the desired results. In the end, all of us were happy with 
       the outcome.​
